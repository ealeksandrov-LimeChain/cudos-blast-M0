# Cudos Blast
hayaaaaaaaa

Cudos Blast is a Node.js CLI (command line interface) tool for working with the Cudos blockchain. You can scaffold, compile and test your **Rust** smart contracts. JavaScript and Rust testing is supported.
Utilizing `blast.config.js` it provides a possibility for deploying and interacting with them on a specified network (local, test or public).
By using this tool you can also spin up a local [`Cudos node`](https://github.com/CudoVentures/cudos-node) and interact with it.

## Installation

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) installed.  [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install) is also required.

| Prerequisite   | Minimum version | Recommended version |
| ---            | ---             | ---                 |
| Node.js        | 14.15.0         | 16.10.0             |
| npm            | 6.9.0           | 7.24.0              |
| Docker engine  | 19.03.13        | 20.10.12            |
| Docker compose | 1.27.4          | 1.29.2              |  

> For Windows users we recommend using Windows Subsystem for Linux ([WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual#downloading-distros)).
> To avoid permission issues with `WSL`, you may have to [change](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally#manually-change-npms-default-directory) `npm` default directory. 

Cudos Blast can be used through a local installation in your project or by installing it globally.

### Local Installation

Create an npm project by going to an empty folder, then run
`npm init`
 and follow the instructions. Once your project is ready, run 
`npm install cudos-blast`.
 To use your local installation of Cudos Blast, use `npx blast`.

### Global Installation

You can let npm completely manage Cudos Blast package just by using `npx cudos-blast` to directly run commands. That way you will always be using the latest version of Cudos Blast so it is possible to have future compatibility issues. We recommend running

```bash
npm install cudos-blast -g
```

to install globally and using Cudos Blast by `blast` as all the examples in this guide do.

---
## Help and version

Run `--help` or `help` on any `blast` command to show all available subcommands, parameters and additional information. 

```bash
blast --help
blast help
blast node --help
blast node start help
```

You can display `cudos-blast` version number using `--version`.

```bash
blast --version
```

---
## Initializing a project

To scaffold a sample project navigate to empty directory (or your npm project for local cudos-blast installation) and run

```bash
blast init
```

You can also specify the full directory of the project using optional parameter `--dir` or `-d`

```bash
blast init --dir /Your/Location/Here
```

The project is now ready to work with the Cudos blockchain. It contains sample smart contracts and scripts to deploy or interact. The new project's `npm` dependencies are automatically installed.  
> Make sure to initialize a new project in a directory other than the local repository folder, or else `cudos-blast` will break and the repository have to be cloned again.  
> Also, all `blast` commands are designed to be executed from the project root directory.

---
## Compiling smart contracts

To compile all smart contracts run

```bash
blast compile
```

The contracts have to be in `{project_root}/contracts/` folder. Cudos Blast comes with sample contracts you can use. All contracts are compiled in alphabetical order and as a Rust workspace. If you want to add more folders to compile, all you have to do is edit the base `{project_root}/Cargo.toml` file and add your folder under `members`. The compilation is done using [rust-optimizer](https://github.com/CosmWasm/rust-optimizer) and the artifacts in `{project_root}/artifacts/` folder are optimized for deployment.

---
## Running Rust tests

Rust tests are organized by the Rust convention for writing tests. You can check them in their corresponding contracts in `{project_root}/contracts/{contract_name}/`. To run smart contracts' Rust tests:

```bash
blast rusttest
```

To run the Rust tests without printing cargo log messages use `--quiet` or `-q`

```bash
blast rusttest -q
```

---
## Testing contracts with JavaScript

Cudos Blast uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io) framework for testing. Test files must be in `{project_root}/tests/` folder. You can use the provided sample test as a template or make one or more tests of your own. You can run the [default local node](#starting-a-local-node) in order to deploy or interact with the smart contracts in your tests. To connect to a non-local Cudos node such as testnet or your own node, follow these [instructions](#network).

```bash
describe('alpha contract', () => {
  const MSG_INIT = { count: 13 }
  const MSG_INCREMENT = { increment: {} }
  const MSG_RESET = { reset: { count: 1 } }
  const QUERY_GET_COUNT = { get_count: {} }

  let alice, bob, contract

  // deploying alpha contract once before test cases
  beforeAll(async () => {
    // 'bre' is available in global context
    [alice, bob] = await bre.getSigners()
    contract = await bre.getContractFactory('alpha')
    await contract.deploy(MSG_INIT, 'alpha', { signer: bob })
  })

  // positive test case
  test('increment count', async () => {
    await contract.execute(MSG_INCREMENT, alice)
    return expect(contract.query(QUERY_GET_COUNT))
      .resolves.toEqual({ count: 14 })
  })

  // ...

  // negative test case
  test('reset count from user throws unauthorized', () => {
    return expect(contract.execute(MSG_RESET, alice))
      .rejects.toThrow('Unauthorized')
  })
})
```

Run all test files with

```bash
blast test
blast test -n testnet
```

You can also run the tests with disabled console logging and show only essential test result information. To do this use `--silent` or `-s`

```bash
blast test --silent
```

---
## Interacting with a Cudos node

You can interact with a local [`Cudos node`](https://github.com/CudoVentures/cudos-node) with `blast node` command.

### Starting a local node

To start a fresh local Cudos node run

```bash
blast node start
```

or you can show the node logging output in current terminal window. To do this use `--log` or `-l`.

```bash
blast node start -l
```

To see how to manage local node accounts go [here](#managing-accounts).

### Stopping a running local node

To stop a running node run

```bash
blast node stop
```

### Checking node status

To check whether any Cudos node is online or offline run

```bash
blast node status
blast node status -n testnet
```

More information about connecting to a non-local Cudos node [here](#network).

---
## Deploying smart contracts, interacting with them and running custom script files

You can use the supplied `{project_root}/scripts/deploy.js` to deploy a sample smart contract.

```bash
async function main () {
  // functions such as 'getSigners' and 'getContractFactory' are available in global context
  const [alice, bob] = await bre.getSigners()

  // get contract object of 'alpha' contract in 'contracts/alpha'
  const contract = await bre.getContractFactory('alpha')

  // define instantiate message for the contract
  // in this message you can set called function and its parameters
  const MSG_INIT = { count: 13 }

  // deploying the contract with bob as a signer (default signer would be alice)
  const deploy = await contract.deploy(MSG_INIT, 'alpha', { signer: bob })

  // get useful info such as contractAddress from deploy transaction
  const contractAddress = deploy.instantiateTx.contractAddress

  // printing contract address so it can be copied and used in other scripts such as interact.js
  console.log(`Contract deployed at: ${contractAddress}`)
}
// ...
```

Deploy the contract by running the script:

```bash
blast run scripts/deploy.js
```

When the contract is deployed, its address will be printed. Then you can edit `{project_root}/scripts/interact.js` with the new address

```bash
async function main() {
  const [alice, bob] = await bre.getSigners()

  // replace the address with the new one from your deployed smart contract
  const contract = await bre.getContractFromAddress('cudos1uul3yzm2lgskp3dxpj0zg558hppxk6pt8t00qe')
// ...
```

and run the script to interact with the deployed smart contract.

```bash
blast run scripts/interact.js
```

When running scripts through `blast run` the `bre` object in injected. It provides various useful functions to interact with cudos blockchain network. You can also `require` the `cudos-blast` library to access the same functions and enable your code editor's intellisense.

```bash
const bre = require('cudos-blast')
```

You are free to use these sample files as templates or create your own custom `.js` scripts. You can specify your own script file path. 

```bash
blast run scripts/myCustomScript.js
blast run newFolder/anotherScripts/myCustomScript.js
```

| options = { gasMultiplier } | `gasLimit` multiplier. Defaults to "auto" or 1.3. `gasMultiplier` is taken into consideration only when auto `gasLimit` is used. |

### Additional options

* You can run your scripts on a different node. More information [here](#network)
* You can set a custom address prefix under `addressPrefix` in `blast.config.js`. The default prefix is `cudos`

```bash
blast run scripts/myCustomScript.js -n testnet
```

* You can automatically fund smart contracts with tokens in your scripts

```bash
async function main () {
  const [alice, bob] = await getSigners()
  const contract = await getContractFactory('alpha')
  const MSG_INIT = { count: 13 }

  const deploy = await contract.deploy(MSG_INIT, 'alpha', { signer: bob, fund: 123 })
  // ...
```

* Gas fees are calculated and applied per transaction. Note that `deploy()` function submits two separate transactions (upload code + instantiate), and therefore auto `gasLimit` and `gasMultiplier` are used.
* You can specify gas price from `blast.config.js`. It is used in format `<amount>acudos`

## Creating a custom task

Cudos Blast allows the creation of custom tasks that can easily run commonly used operations or help manage your workflow.
This guide shows you how to create a sample task to print a parameter from the CLI.

Let's add the following line in our `blast.config.js` outside of the scope of `module.exports`:
  
```js
require('cudos-blast/utilities/task.js')

task("print", "Prints a custom parameter").setAction(async () => {});
```

It is a good practice to split your code into several files and `require` them from the config file for more complex tasks.

After adding it, you should be able to see the task and its description in `blast --help`.

```bash
Usage: blast <command> [arguments] [command options]

Commands:
  blast init                  Create a sample project
  blast compile               Compile the smart contracts in the workspace in
                              alphabetical order
  blast test                  Run the JavaScript tests
  blast rusttest              Run smart contracts rust tests
  blast node                  Manage a local CUDOS node
  blast run <scriptFilePath>  Run a single script
  blast keys                  Manage node accounts (keys)
  blast print                 Prints a custom parameter

Options:
  --version  Show version number                                       [boolean]
  --help     Show help                                                 [boolean]
```
now let's add a param to our task

```js
require('cudos-blast/utilities/task.js')
task("print", "Prints a custom parameter")
  .addParam("param", "Our custom parameter")
  .setAction(async (argv) => {
    console.log(`Printing our param... ${argv.param}`)
  });

module.exports.config = {
// ...

```

Now we can simply invoke it by running:

```bash
blast print --param "important thing to print"
```

You can add as many parameteres with `.addParam()` as you need.

You should know that every task must end with `.setAction()` so it can take it's place.

## Network

You can connect to the default local node as well as a public one or you can use your own Cudos node. To do that, add a `{custom_name}: {node_url}` to `networks` field in `blast.config.js`, then call the `run`, `test` or `node status` command with `--network` or `-n` followed by `{custom_name}`. If no network is passed, blast commands connect to the default local node.  
Here are Cudos nodes you can use to connect to Cudos network:

### Localhost

| Chain ID      | URL                    |
| ---           | ---                    |
| cudos-network | http://localhost:26657 |

### Testnet

| Chain ID               | URL                                            |
| ---                    | ---                                            |
| cudos-testnet-public-3 | https://sentry1.gcp-uscentral1.cudos.org:36657 |

### Mainnet

| Chain ID       | URL                   |
| ---            | ---                   |
|    cudos-1     | https://rpc.cudos.org |

## Managing accounts

By default local Cudos node starts with 10 predefined accounts funded with `acudos`. You can set how many additional random accounts to load when starting a local node in `blast.config.js` under `additionalAccounts`. If any additional accounts are added, `customAccountBalances` field must be set for the amount of tokens that these accounts will be funded with. Predefined and additionally generated accounts are written in `{project_root}/local-accounts.json`. Another way to manage custom accounts is through `blast keys` command.  
You can put your private accounts in `{project_root}/private-accounts.json`. Initializing a new project automatically adds this file to `.gitignore`. **Make sure you keep `private-accounts.json` in `.gitignore` in order to prevent accidentally committing and exposing your private accounts.**. The `private-accounts.json` file is mainly meant to have existing accounts in other networks (testnet, mainnet, etc). If you also want to have these accounts in your local environment, make sure [you add them to your local node keyring](https://docs.cudos.org/build/fundnodes.html#stashing-the-wallet-keys).

### Listing local node accounts

To list all accounts in the local node key storage run

```bash
blast keys ls
```

### Adding a new local node account

To add a new account named `myAccount1` to the local node key storage run
  
```bash
blast keys add myAccount1
```

After adding the new account, it is automatically funded with `acudos` tokens from the default local node faucet.

### Removing an existing local node account

To remove an account from the node key storage run

```bash
blast keys rm myAccount1
```

You can skip the delete confirmation with `--force` or `-f`

```bash
blast keys rm myAccount1 -f
```

---
### Funding an existing local node account

You can fund an account with additional tokens. To specify tokens amount use `--tokens` or `-t`.

```bash
blast keys fund myAccount1 --tokens 1000000
```

The tokens are funded from the default local node faucet in `acudos`.
